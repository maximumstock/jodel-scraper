# jodel-scraper

A scraper for [Jodel](https://www.jodel-app.com) written in Elixir.
Scrapes most recent, discussed and upvoted jodels and stores them in a Postgres database.

## Project status
As of July 21st, 2017, the way authorization works with the private API of Jodel is about 
to change heavily, which renders this project useless at this point.
